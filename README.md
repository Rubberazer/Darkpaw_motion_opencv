# Darkpaw_motion_opencv
A little project in C/C++ for the Adeept Darkpaw robot
Basically replaced the original maker's python code by my own C code -with a pinch of C++ forteh OpenCV bit, this is an original commit and still have to decide what to do with the camera. I added a typical ultrasound sensor (the usual HC-SR04) so the robot doesn't hit the walls so easily. At the moment the robot can move: forwards, backwards, turn right and left. In a future developments will also try to incorporate teh gyroscope that comes along the kit somehow.
